## How I Define The Monolith

First things first, I am far from the first to use "Monolith" to refer to people operating in bad faith and trying to remove all nuance from complex discussions such as those surrounding Syria. I have no intention to claim the term.

With that said, I define "The Monolith" as a creation, usually rhetorical, that attempts to remove the nuances of unique situations to paint a single clean narrative in support of a specific movement or ideology. The Monolith that is created usually highlights elements (or even just the perception of elements) that are viewed as similar between situations, while completely ignoring any inconsistencies or contradictions, or handwaving them. In the work I do, I usually see this Monolith created to paint various conflicts going on around the world as following a single thread. This is more than just highlighting similar problems that lead to the conflict, or acknowledging that in the modern era world events are often inherently more connected than they used to be. Rather, I see people [claiming over a half dozen unique and complex situations](https://twitter.com/eilistweets/status/1414468275782750215) were all simply US orchestrated regime change operations. This serves as a very informative example of what the Monolith is, and how dangerous it can become. To be clear, **comparative assessment and discussion around these situations is a good thing**. What *isn't*, is whitewashing them all, watering them down until they neatly fit a narrative, and then selling that narrative to people who do not understand the nuances of each individual case.

If this sounds at all familiar, it's because it's a fundamental underpinning of many propaganda tactics. Propaganda is rarely both effective **and** nuanced. In fact, very little propaganda is nuanced at all. Propaganda is often used like marketing by movements, ideologies and institutions. If you're familiar with the basics of marketing, you're likely familiar with many of the basics of propaganda. This is part of the truth behind the [you are not immune to propaganda](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-are-not-immune-to-propaganda) meme. Maybe you can pick out a military recruitment poster as propaganda, but if you can fall for marketing (and all of us can) you can fall for propaganda. 

## How The Monolith and Propaganda Intersect

I don't really see the Monolith and propaganda as one and the same. I wouldn't even define the Monolith as wholly an example of propaganda. I see people hold a monolithic mindset even when they aren't trying to sell anyone on anything. I think it is fairly natural (at least within the systems we live in) for people to seek out information that confirms their beliefs, and put less effort into seeking out information that may change how they think about things. There's so many aspects of our life that we are meant to take for granted, and it's quite difficult to fight against a mindset so engrained. The Monolith can become an extension of this, where distinct, nuanced situations one hears about through various outlets can be twisted to fit into their beliefs. Situations that aren't ignored outright are usually ones that, on the face of them, can be spun. The Syrian Civil War is a clear example of this. No matter which "side" you support, or if you don't support any side at all, you can probably look at the situation and draw a conclusion that supports your worldview. Whether it's anarchism, communism, stalinism, maoism, neoliberalism, fascism, you can fairly easily paint a narrative. And what I'm getting at here is that ***this is the problem***.  You shouldn't begin learning about a situation trying to see how it fits into your world view. You should be allowing your world view to be shaped *by what you learn* while exploring a topic. 

This isn't to imply that I don't make this mistake myself, I do. It is rather an expression of my frustration with just how often I see people falling into these trappings, even people I share a similar ideology to and respect greatly. Uncritical support only serves movements looking for unthinking followers. Movements looking to actively improve things should be willing to accept criticism, even if it results in a base of followers that is less dedicated to individual movement leaders and less willing to blindly march towards someone else's goal. 

As for painting any movement you don't like as some foreign conspiracy, well that often boils down to racism and chauvinism. It denies the agency of people in other regions and treats them as nothing more than sheep, or children. Too often we see people, especially those from the west, completely failing to understand how complex uprisings protests and warzones are, and how difficult it is to make choices during these situations. People do things for reasons, and trying to understand these reasons is far more valuable than assuming you know better than those actually living in these places. Likewise, all movements make mistakes, wrong choices, and tough decisions. Instead of handwaving, ignoring, or whitewashing these, acknowledge them. Try to understand why and how they came about and do what you can to help them not happen again. There's only so much we can do, but our voices are still powerful tools and we have a responsibility to use them wisely. Doubling down instead of learning will only drive you towards bappism and similar ideological cults like many tankie circles. Sure, these can be entertaining in their absurdity and insistence on a policy of "just posting through it", but there's serious repercussions as well. 

### Conclusion

Sorry for a rambly post today. The recent discourse I've seen has pushed me to try and gather my thoughts together for a statement. Half-way through writing I also had a minor migraine hit me rather suddenly, so if there's a noticeable tone shift or disconnect, that may be why. I do hope what I've said here has some value to people. The Monolith is a phenomenon I've wanted to share my thoughts on for a long time. It dominates so much of the discourse I see, and has been pushing me to try and find a synthesis of nuance and engagement that avoids the Monolith while also keeping people interested in what I have to say.

Who knows, some day I may even succeed.

Thanks for reading! Currently the website does not have a contact page but I am looking into setting that up. For now you can let me know your thoughts on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Eimileros). I'd love to know what everyone thought! If you want to contact me privately you can either DM me on twitter, or send me an email at GormRos@Protonmail.com. Please note the Arabic version of the website is not currently set up. It has limited functionality at the moment. It will take me a while to figure out how to get everything working there, and even longer to begin posting in Arabic, as I cannot write in it, and so I'll be fairly dependent on translation. 

Have a great week!

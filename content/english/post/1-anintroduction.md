## What is Apoism?

This is a question I see a lot online, and have often been directly asked. Despite how often it comes up, I've always struggled to find a definition I'm happy with. I think this is primarily because no ideology, or set of ideologies, can really be condensed into a brief definition without opening up room for misinterpretation. With that said, I want to do my best to underline the fundamental underpinnings of Democratic Confederalism.

I would list the following as the core foundations of Apoism:

- **[Jineology](https://jineoloji.org/en/)**, a radical feminist study inspecting how the oppression of all people is linked to the oppression of women. The idea that no society can be free until women are free.
- **Ecology**, specifically influenced from Murray Bookchin's ["Social Ecology"](https://social-ecology.org), though with Abdullah Öcalan's personal insights on the ecological requirements of the Middle East.
- **Autonomy over Independence**, which is the belief that groups seeking independence from a nation-state will inevitably either reproduce the institutions and abuses of the state, or be destroyed by the state. Öcalan instead advocates for autonomy within the nation-state, through political or militant ends where necessary.
- **Internationalism**, a long standing element of Democratic Confederalism, though most apparent in "Syrian Apoism" in recent years, as seen when the YPG and its allies accepted many international volunteers through the International Freedom Battalion, modelled after the Spanish Republican "International Brigades". This is just one example however, and there are many examples of non-militant internationalist elements of Apoism.
- **Self Criticism**, an element stemming directly from the PKK. Self Criticism does not refer specifically to one thinking critically about their own views, but also a general climate that encourages and empowers individuals to be critical of their peers and of movement leaders.

While not all of these elements are universally applied, and in some cases are applied unsuccessfully, they are the core foundational elements which can be identified across Apoism in Bakur, Rojhilat, Rojava and Bashur, as well as non-Kurdish communities and groups that follow Democratic Confederalism directly, or an ideology influenced by it. 

As the informal name "Apoism" implies, the ideology is heavily influenced and popularized by the Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, known diminutively as "Apo". That said, in my opinion many are too quick to attribute the entire ideology to Öcalan and Bookchin. This leads in a dangerous direction, especially for an ideology that perhaps first and foremost centres the freedom of women. The PKK and KCK have various female leaders and thinkers who Öcalan was consciously and subconsciously influenced by throughout the latter half of his life. Likewise, Öcalan himself has had a very limited platform to publish work through since his inhumane [imprisonment](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abdullah-Ocalan#ref343572) in Turkey. Because of this, others have continued to develope Jineology (and Democratic Confederalism as a whole) without direct input from him, using his published and stated ideas as a basis. One of the most important examples of this to highlight is [Kongra Star (Star Congress)](https://eng.kongra-star.org/), a civil network of women's groups in Rojava, North Eastern Syria.

Kongra Star is not directly affiliated with the leadership of the Autonomous Administration of North and Eastern Syria (AANES), other than their coordination for education and community projects. It is a grass-roots movement that predates the Syrian Civil War, though the de facto autonomous state (state here refers to the state of being, not a nation-state) of North Eastern Syria has provided them the ability to work publicly, whereas before they had been considered an illegal group by the Syrian government, and had to work discretely. Kongra Star has done more work to develop Jineology than they often get credit for. While Öcalan was important to the equality and freedom of women in the PKK, he was able to lead the PKK in-person for decades. The revolution in Rojava, however, is taking place while he is imprisoned, and even if he was free he would not be able to manage things on the ground in person. Because of this, and how much territory the YPG, YPJ and their allies were able to liberate, it was the responsibility of those living in North Eastern Syria to develope solutions to their unique circumstances themselves. Kongra Star has developed Jineology to apply to the actual conditions in Syria, to great success. I find it quite frustrating (and can only imagine how frustrating it must be for the many women contributing to the revolution in Rojava and AANES) to see time and time again people focus only on Öcalan's contributions to Jineology. I don't think they could get away with focusing on a few men who made major contributions to feminism and ignore women's contributions. Jineology does not exist without radical women. Radical women inspired and consulted with Öcalan. Öcalan certainly deserves credit for his eloquent manner of writing on the topic, and for actually listening to the women around him, but should not be the only voice one listens to on Jineology. 

## Democratic Confederalism Outside the Middle East

Having covered what I consider to be the core foundations of Apoism, I want to discuss how Democratic Confederalism has impacted me, and how I believe it applies to areas outside of Kurdistan and the Middle East. Those who have followed me online for some time may know that I am highly critical of people who take an ideology from one part of the world, that was designed for the lived conditions of that time and place, and attempt to apply it directly to another. I carry this skepticism and critical view over to Democratic Confederalism, however it does have some notable differences. As I mentioned above, is how fundamental internationalism is to the ideology. This does not inherently make it applicable to other regions, but it is important that Öcalan was always thinking about how Democratic Confederalism can apply to other regions. Even before the Syrian Civil War, the KCK was doing significant work to build a network of groups around the world, especially in North America and Europe. Since the war started and the autonomous region was established however, we have seen a lot more coordination and solidarity around the world. Unsurprisingly this has led to more people, inspired by AANES, working on applying lessons learned from the region to life outside it. 

Social Ecology has been a major axis upon which this has developed, especially in North America. Given Öcalan's well known inspirations from Bookchin, it is not surprising Democratic Confederalists and Social Ecologists have likewise begun to work much closer together, and in many cases combine efforts. Social Ecology today provides many basic foundations that can be applied to life within the nation-state and a capitalist economy. Unlike some revolutionary ideologies which I feel are more "static", in the sense that they are entirely focused on a potential future revolution, I find Social Ecology to be applicable both to major revolutionary shifts, and day to day life. I would not describe myself as a social ecologist, but I find it very encouraging and healthy to constantly push myself to live in a more natural, harmonious way with the world. Likewise "dual power" and alternative structures are elements quite core to my own beliefs, and I find them to be extremely compatible with Social Ecology and Democratic Confederalism. As I touched on, autonomy is a foundational element of Democratic Confederalism, and I see AANES in many ways as simply a massive extension of the idea of alternative systems. Alternative systems are basically the idea that rather than seeing violent revolution as the first and primary route to freedom, that we can begin to build systems outside of state control which undermine state institutions. While this is not an ultimate end goal, it can provide much more substantive positive change for us than reformist politics or anything the state provides. Not everything can have an alternative system overnight, but any successes can have a huge impact on those must vulnerable. 

### Conclusion

What works in Syria may not work here, but that doesn't mean there isn't major lessons to be learned from the KCK and AANES. This is something I always try to keep in mind in my work. It would be a serious shame to fail to learn from what has happened in the last few decades in Kurdistan and the Middle East. AANES has made significant mistakes, in my opinion, but they are vastly outweighed by the incredible progress that has been seen. Moreover, AANES is not a monolith. It is one of the most densely diverse regions on earth, ethnically, religiously and politically. If I am at all successful in my goals in covering the region then I will have been able to introduce people to the topic in a more nuanced manner than is often seen in western media, and begin conversations that are held in a far more healthy manner than what I've seen on places like twitter, which are frankly horrifying.

Thank you for reading the first ever post on my new website. Currently the website does not have a contact page but I am looking into setting that up. For now you can let me know your thoughts on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Eimileros). I'd love to know what everyone thought! If you want to contact me privately you can either DM me on twitter, or send me an email at GormRos@Protonmail.com. Please note the Arabic version of the website is not currently set up. It has limited functionality at the moment. It will take me a while to figure out how to get everything working there, and even longer to begin posting in Arabic, as I cannot write in it, and so I'll be fairly dependent on translation. 

Have a great week!

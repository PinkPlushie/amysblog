**Hello readers!**

My name is Amelia Corcoran, though I also go by Eimíle Ó Corcráin, my Irish name. I am third generation Irish, with my family mostly coming from Ulster.
Since 2017 I have been studying the war in Syria, sometimes full time. I am no longer in formal education for financial and health reasons, but have 
committed to a studying schedule over the years to improve my understanding of the conflict. More recently I have also begun studying Iraq from the 
Saddam era onward, and to a lesser extent Turkish and Iranian history and politics, mostly as they relate to regional ethnic minorities and the 
ongoing conflicts.

My goal for this blog is to highlight issues and voices I believe **need more attention**. 

Importantly: **I am not an expert on the topics I study**. I don't believe anyone can be an expert on a region they haven't lived in and experienced
first hand. I appreciate the enthusiam folks have shown in my work in the past, but I cannot stress enough how fundamental talking to actual experts
from the region has been to my studies and work. My goal is to convey the info I have gathered to an audience that may not otherwise get it. When I
am stating my own personal opinion I always do my best to clearly seperate them from information I am taking from actual experts from the region.

I deeply appreciate those who have encouraged and supported me along the way to getting where I am today. This work is often draining, containing 
heavy subject matter which takes a genuine toll. That said, I am incredibly privileged to be able to work from relative comfort. Many do not have this
luxery, and that have been important perspective I've gained over the years. To those who have supported me through these years, especially the early
years where I was still quite naive and in the process of learning many important lessons, I cannot put into words how much I appreciate your help and
kind words. 

I hope you enjoy my work going forward. If you would like to contact me, my DMs are open on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/EimileRos).
